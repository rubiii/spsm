#  WP Theme for St. Pauli selber machen


## Development

Use Gulp to build CSS and JavaScript files and Bower to install dependencies.
First you need to install NPM if you havenâ€™t already:

```
npm install
```

Run `bower` to install dependencies:

```
node_modules/.bin/bower install
```

Then you can run `gulp` to build CSS and JavaScript files:

```
node_modules/.bin/gulp
```

You can also make `gulp` watch for file changes:

```
node_modules/.bin/gulp watch
```

## Upload

Gulp creates a `public` directory with all the assets. This folder and everything
in the root directory need to be uploaded to the server. The `assets` directory
as well as the `bower_components` and `node_modules` directories do not need to
be uploaded.
